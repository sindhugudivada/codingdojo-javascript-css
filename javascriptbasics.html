        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. ... Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server.</p>
        <p>       JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                
                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

        <a href="">Variable Declration:</a> a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.
                
                   You declare a JavaScript variable with the var keyword:
                
                   var carName;
                   After the declaration, the variable has no value. (Technically it has the value of undefined)
                
                  To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign:</p>
